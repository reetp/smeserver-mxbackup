                <p>
		By default, SME really hate to be a mail relay. This means
		that, if someone outside your local(s) network(s) 
		try to send to your SME box a mail for 
		a domain that is not owned by this SME box, the mail is
		rejected.</p>
		<p>
		But you can choose to be a second mail server (or MX Backup)
		for some others
		hosts or domains. In this case, you have to set the
		domains or hosts names that you plan to backup.
		You have also to say if you accept only one precise host
		( you accept mail address like <tt>this_guy@bar.foo</tt> 
		but you won't accept <tt>this_other@big.bar.foo</tt>)
		or one complete domain with all
		subdomain (mail address in form <tt>this_guy@*.bar.foo</tt>)
		</p>
		<p>
		Some point of interest :
		</p>
		<p>
		<ul>
		<li>This is only one part of the configuration. This will 
		only work if the DNS of the domains you plan to backup are
		correctly set (that is : your server should be a MX with a 
		priority higher than the 'real' MX server)
		<li>You can choose between a domain and a host, but remember :
		You cannot choose the mailbox ( The left part of the E-Mail address )
		</ul>

		<p>
		Set the domain name or host name you plan to 'MX Backup'.
		If you plan to backup an entire domain select 'Domain'.
		If you're unsure, this is the most sensible choice.
		If you only want to act as a MX Backup for one host (and
		no others hosts that could be sub-domains of this host) then
		select 'Host'.
